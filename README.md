A 16-bit single cyle MIPS processor is implement in Verilog in this project along with an associated testbench file. MIPS is a widely used Reducded Instruction Set Computer (RISC) processor based on the RISC instruction set and Havard-typ data path structure.

Below is a RTl schematic of the MIPS process
